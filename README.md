# Freezer

Freezer is a unique cloud storage client-server application. 
This project is my solo submission to a semester final group project, 
under professor Dr. Keyur Parmar, CS206 Computer Networks and Internet, 
NIT Surat.

## Introduction

A service provided by a popular chat application is exploited 
to provide the client with an "infinite and free" cloud storage. 
A file is sent to the server from the client. 
The server segments the raw file into small chunks of data. Each data 
segment is encrypted and stored on a chat. To retrieve the files, 
the client sends a request to the server, which decrypts and reassembles 
the file, and transmits it back to the client.

## Disclaimer

This project is created for educational and research purposes
 only. Using this application to exploit services provided by chat applications, 
bypass cloud storage services, or engage in illegal activities is strictly prohibited.
The developer of this project is not responsible for any misuse of this application.
