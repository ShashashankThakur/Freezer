# Freezer

Freezer is a unique cloud storage client-server application.

## Introduction

A service provided by a popular chat application is exploited 
to provide the client with an "infinite and free" cloud storage. A file is sent to the server from the client. 
The server segments the raw file into small chunks of data. Each data segment is encrypted and stored on a chat. To retrieve the files, 
the client sends a request to the server, which decrypts and reassembles the file, and transmits it back to the client.

Please note that this project is created for educational and research purposes

bypass cloud storage services or engage in illegal activities is strictly prohibited.
